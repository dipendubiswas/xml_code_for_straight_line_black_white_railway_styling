I understand you want a straight line with a black and white color combination for a railway track style using the XML code you provided. To achieve this, you can modify your code like this:
This XML code encapsulates a sophisticated railway track styling for geospatial representations. The code employs the Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) format to define an eye-catching visualization of railway tracks. By utilizing alternating black and white dash patterns, the code accurately simulates the distinctive appearance of railway tracks. Each <sld:Rule> within the <sld:FeatureTypeStyle> specifies a different stroke configuration. The first <sld:Rule> establishes a solid black line, while the second <sld:Rule> cleverly integrates a dashed line with alternating black and white segments, capturing the essence of railway tracks in a visually engaging manner. With this code, the intricate balance of XML styling and geospatial representation converges to create an accurate and appealing portrayal of railway tracks.
